# Monadic Lists in Golang


[Monads](https://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html) abstract the context of a computation. Where "context" could be quantity (a list), availability (a thing that can be nil), fallibility (something that, when executed, can produce an error), asynchronous execution (something that is not yet present), etc. And **computation** is just applying a function to the value whithin the context, and the result will be in the same context. Here's the list of _monadic go_:

List is the context that is easier to be used to explain the concept of a monad, so let's use it.

I strongly recommend you to read the following article if you still have not done it yet:

- [Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures](https://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)

## Functor

Let's start with `Functor` category, don't be afraid of it, it just mean: _a "container" whose elements can be transformed inside it_.

Consider the following example:

```go
words := []string{"foo", "bar", "baz"}

upperWords := []string{}

for _, w := range words {
    upperWords = append(upperWords, strings.ToUpper(w)
}

fmt.Printf("%v\n", upperWords)
// will print FOO BAR BAZ
```

And now, let's define a functor over a list, it's just a function:

```go
package lists

func Map[A, B any](as []A, f func(A) B) []B {
	bs := make([]B, len(as))

	for i := range as {
		bs[i] = f(as[i])
	}

	return bs
}
```

And it could be used this way:

```go
words := []string{"foo", "bar", "baz"}

upperWords := lists.Map(words, func(s string) string {
    return strings.ToUpper(s)
})

fmt.Printf("%v -> %v\n", words, upperWords)
```

What we did is to abstract the list and its iteration away, and describe the transformation as _given a list, I want to map all its elements with this function_

It could be even shorter, as this:

```go
words := []string{"foo", "bar", "baz"}

upperWords := lists.Map(words, strings.ToUpper)

fmt.Printf("%v -> %v\n", words, upperWords)
```

Now it looks concise. The more complex our code is becoming, the more important os to express on _higher voice_ the intent of our operations and do not allow them to be overshadowed by implementation details.

To make it a real Functor, we also need to fulfill a few rules:

Let's `Id` be the following function:

```go
func Id[A any](a A) A {
    return a
}
```

Rules:

1. `lists.Map(as, Id) == as` for any list `as` regardless its type (identity rule)
2. `lists.Map(lists.Map(as, f), g)` == `lists.Map(as, func gof(a A) C { return g(f(a)) }` for any list `as` and any `func f[A, B any](A) B` and any `func g[B any](B) C` -- associativity


## Applicative

Applicatives are functors that can be merged. Also They have a function to put a value into the context. so:

```go
// lists.go

func Pure[A any](a A) []A {
    return []A{a}
}
```

We can use it very simple:

```
// main.go

singleValueInList := lists.Pure(10)

fmt.Println(singleValueInList) // will print [10]
```

And for combining two applicatives:

```go
func Map2[A, B, C any](as []A, bs []B, f func(A, B) C) []C {
	cs := []C{}

	for i := range as {
		a := as[i]
		for j := range bs {
			b := bs[j]
			cs = append(cs, f(a, b))
		}
	}

	return cs
}
```

And we can use it this way:

```go
odds := []int{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
evens := []int{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}

multiplication := lists.Map2(odds, evens, func (i, j int) int {
    return i * j
})

fmt.Printf("%v x %v = %v\n", odds, evens, multiplication)
// will print:
// [1 3 5 7 9] x [0 2 4 6 8] = [0 2 4 6 8 0 6 12 18 24 0 10 20 30 40 0 14 28 42 56 0 18 36 54 72]
```

Interesting things come when we start chaining transformations over lists, example, given the following code with several transformations:

```go
type T2[A, B any] struct {
	Fst A
	Snd B
} // tuple to hold two values

odds := []int{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
evens := []int{0, 2, 4, 6}

fmt.Printf("odds: %v\nevens: %v\n\n", odds, evens)

var pairs []T2[int, int] = lists.Map2(
	odds, evens, func(o, e int) T2[int, int] {
		return T2[int, int]{Fst: o, Snd: e}
	},
)

fmt.Printf("pairs: %v\n", pairs)

// Fst is the original pairs ([]T2[int, int]), Snd is the sum of each value
var additions []T2[T2[int, int], int] = lists.Map(
    pairs,
    func(t T2[int, int]) T2[T2[int, int], int] {
        return T2[T2[int, int], int]{t, t.Fst + t.Snd}
    },
)

// express each operation as a + b = c, e.g. 1 + 2 = 3
var operations []string = lists.Map(
	additions,
	func(t T2[T2[int, int], int]) string {
		return fmt.Sprintf("%d + %d = %d", t.Fst.Fst, t.Fst.Snd, t.Snd)
	},
)

for _, o := range operations {
	fmt.Println(o)
}
```

Now consider same code on a single expression:

```go
type T2[A, B any] struct {
    Fst A
    Snd B
} // tuple to hold two values

odds := []int{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
evens := []int{0, 2, 4, 6}

var makePairs = func(o, e int) T2[int, int] {
    return T2[int, int]{Fst: o, Snd: e}
}

var sumPreservingOperands = func(t T2[int, int]) T2[T2[int, int], int] {
    return T2[T2[int, int], int]{Fst: t, Snd: t.Fst + t.Snd}
}

var sumOperationToString = func(t T2[T2[int, int], int]) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%d + %d = %d", t.Fst.Fst, t.Fst.Snd, t.Snd)
}

// express each operation as a + b = c, e.g. 1 + 2 = 3
var operations []string = lists.Map(
    lists.Map(
        lists.Map2(odds, evens, makePairs),
        sumPreservingOperands,
    ),
    sumOperationToString,
)

for _, o := range operations {
    fmt.Println(o)
}
```

The expression is very concise although it performs a series of complex operations:
1. It combines two lists using `makePairs` function to keep both elements on same structure.
2. It performs an addition operation and put the original data on a structure, so, both: operands and result are returned.
3. It converts each structure of operations and result into a human readable format.

Given the functor laws, we can make main expression even more compact, consider the following code:

```go
package function

func Pipe[A, B, C any](f func(A) B, g func(B) C) func(A) C {
	return func(a A) C {
		return g(f(a))
	}
}
```

We can do the following:

```go
type T2[A, B any] struct {
	Fst A
	Snd B
} // tuple to hold two values

odds := []int{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
evens := []int{0, 2, 4, 6}

var makePairs = func(o, e int) T2[int, int] {
	return T2[int, int]{Fst: o, Snd: e}
}

var sumPreservingOperands = func(t T2[int, int]) T2[T2[int, int], int] {
	return T2[T2[int, int], int]{Fst: t, Snd: t.Fst + t.Snd}
}

var sumOperationToString = func(t T2[T2[int, int], int]) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%d + %d = %d", t.Fst.Fst, t.Fst.Snd, t.Snd)
}

var sumToString func(t T2[int, int]) string = function.Pipe(
    sumPreservingOperands, sumOperationToString,
)

var operations []string = lists.Map(
	lists.Map2(odds, evens, makePairs),
	sumToString,
)

for _, o := range operations {
	fmt.Println(o)
}
```

This is a small example of the power of lists as Functors/Applicatives. Unfortunately go is very verbose to write anonymous functions but Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯.

Applicatives have their own laws you can read about them here:

## Monads

A monad is just an Applicative (hence it is also a Functor) that can map functions that return instances of the monad and flatten them.

An example may help a bit more, consider the functor function `Map` for lists we already seen:

```go
func Map[A, B any](as []A, func (A) B) []B { ... }
```

Now, let's use the following function on it:

```go
// if n = 0, it will return []
// if n = 1, it will return [1]
// if n = 2, it will return [2, 2]
// if n = 3, it will return [3, 3, 3]
func Repeat(n int) []int {
	is := make([]int, n)

	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		is[i] = n
	}
	
	return is
}
```

What will be the resulting type when applying it to a list of integers?

```go
list1 := []int { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }

// what is the type of list2?
list2 := lists.Map(list1, Repeat)
```

The type of `list2` will be `[][]int`, not `[]int`. We cannot continue adding more transformations unless we do something.

And if we repeat this process few times, we may end with `[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]...[]int` ðŸ¤¦

**Monad to the Rescue**

A monad defines a method `FlatMap` that takes that function and instead of returning `[][]int` it will "flatten" it to `[]int`

This is the implementation:

```go
func FlatMap[A, B any](as []A, f func(A) []B) []B {
	// we don't know in advance the size of the list
	flattenBs := []B{}

	for i := range as {
		bs := f(as[i])

		for j := range bs {
			flattenBs = append(flattenBs, bs[j])
		}
	}

	return flattenBs
}
```

With it we can do the following:

```go
l1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Repeat := func(n int) []int {
	ns := make([]int, n)

	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		ns[i] = n
	}

	return ns
}

l2 := lists.FlatMap(l1, Repeat)

fmt.Printf("l1: %v\nl2: %v\n", l1, l2)
// output:
// l1: [1 2 3 4 5]
// l2: [1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5]
```

Things can be more interesting if we define a function in (e.g.) `lists` package:


```go
package lists

// ...

func Filter[A any](predicate func(A) bool) func(A) []A {
	return func(a A) []A {
		if predicate(a) {
			return []A{a}
		}

		return []A{}
	}
}
```

Then we can produce a new list with some elements _removed_ based on a predicate, e.g. `func isOdd(n int) bool`, let's do that and watch results:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"frunix.org/eraseme/lists"
)

func main() {
	l1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

	IsOdd := func(n int) bool {
		return (n % 2) == 1
	}

	l2 := lists.FlatMap(l1, lists.Filter(IsOdd))

	Repeat := func(n int) []int {
		ns := make([]int, n)

		for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
			ns[i] = n
		}

		return ns
	}

	l3 := lists.FlatMap(l2, Repeat)

	fmt.Printf("l1: %v\nl2: %v\nl3: %v\n", l1, l2, l3)
}
// output:
// l1: [1 2 3 4 5]
// l2: [1 3 5]
// l3: [1 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5]
```

## Lists are Foldable (a.k.a. Reduce)
(note: this section deserves it's own article (WIP))

We already implemented `lists.Map` and `lists.Filter`, for having complete `map-reduce` approach for golang slices, we need another category: `Foldable` (Yes we are applying category theory without Math Phd.)

Foldables are things that can be "folded", usually, that means a sort of container (e.g. a slice) that can be reduced to a single value.

Given types `T` and `A` (`T` stands for _the type_, `A` stands for _accumulator_), and a function `func combine(accumulated A, t T) A`, we say the container `F[T]` is foldable if for type `A` we can provide a `neutral` element for the function `combine` and we can reduce all elements of `F[T]` and produce a single result `A`.

If that sounded complicated, it is not in practice,for lists we can define this function:

```go
// the "l" in Foldl stands for "left"
// because we combine values from left to right
func Foldl[A, T any](ts []T, empty A, combine func(A, T) A) A {
	accumulated := empty

	for i := range ts {
		accumulated = combine(accumulated, ts[i])
	}

	return accumulated
}
```

We can apply it to our example this way to complete the map-filter-reduce cycle.

Lets define a type to capture basic statistics of a list of numbers:

```go
type Stats struct {
	NumberOfElements int
	Sum              int
	Product          int
	Average          float64
	Min              int
	Max              int
}
```

Let's create a "zero" instance of this structure, so multiplication can work:

```go
StatsZero := func() Stats {
	return Stats{
		// the rest of fields will work
		// unchanged
		Product: 1,
	}
}
```

Now let's define a function that takes a previous `Stats` structure and a new `int` and produces an updated version of `Stats` (it's a bit large but it's just the calculation of the above fields):

```go
UpdateStats := func(prev Stats, new int) Stats {
	newNumberOfElements := prev.NumberOfElements + 1
	newSum := prev.Sum + new

	newMin := prev.Min
	if newMin > new {
		newMin = new
	}

	newMax := prev.Max
	if newMax < new {
		newMax = new
	}

	return Stats{
		NumberOfElements: prev.NumberOfElements + 1,
		Sum:              prev.Sum + new,
		Product:          prev.Product * new,
		Average:          float64(newSum) / float64(newNumberOfElements),
		Min:              newMin,
		Max:              newMax,
	}
}
```

And finally we can incorporate it to calculate the stats of the list we already obtained:

```go
stats := lists.Foldl(l3, StatsZero(), UpdateStats)

fmt.Printf("l1: %v\nl2: %v\nl3: %v\nstats: %#v\n", l1, l2, l3, stats)

//output
// l1: [1 2 3 4 5]
// l2: [1 3 5]
// l3: [1 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5]
// stats: main.Stats{NumberOfElements:9, Sum:35, Product:84375, Average:3.888888888888889, Min:0, Max:5}
```

There are many other things we can talk about lists (aka slices/arrays) under functional perspective, but I hope with this I gave you a different perspective on the code we have daily.

Next time I'll try to aplay most of these concepts to golang channels + goroutines and we can see they apply; so next time we can operate on complex asynchronous operations as if they were just slices with `Map`, `Map2`, `FlatMap`, `Filter`, and `Foldl` (and a couple of new things: `Traversable` and `distribute`)
